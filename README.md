# Motto

![Motto front page](https://www.nheek.no/featured-projects/motto.png)

Motto is inspired by the film Ron's Gone Wrong. It is a virtual friend that should be able to talk to you naturally and be there when you need it! The name "Motto" was coined by my brother who heard me brainstorming about the name that I should use. AI logic originally built from scratch is now made easy with OpenAI!
